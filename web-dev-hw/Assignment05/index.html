    <p><h3>All Systems Red</h3></p></body>
    <br>
    <br>       
    </p>All Systems Red is set in the far future in Corporation Rim, 
    an interplanetary system that is controlled by an all-powerful company.
    The narrator is the protagonist, Murderbot, a Security Unit (SecUnit)
    that is part human clone and part robot. Robots or constructs, as they are called, 
    are usually under the control of a governor, a software system that limits their 
    functionality based on their role. On a previous mission, however, a software malfunction 
    made Murderbot kill a crew of 57 miners, which is why it gave itself the name
    “Murderbot.” Afterward, Murderbot hacked its control module so it would not be subject 
    to such malfunctions. Now, it can choose which information packets to download. 
    Its most treasured feature is that it is free to watch endless hours of media, 
    particularly a drama series called Sanctuary Moon. 
<br>
 <p>Murderbot narrates the novel in the first-person past tense. Its tone is casual and 
    humorous; it is lazy and would rather spend its time watching Sanctuary Moon. 
    Murderbot’s current mission is to provide security for a group of scientists who are 
    surveying a planet for its natural resources. During a routine survey outing, a giant 
    creature attacks two of the scientists. Murderbot saves them, and in the process, 
    it reveals human traits that are not part of its programming: It soothes one of the 
    scientists until they safely reach the habitat. This instance is the team’s first 
    indication that Murderbot is acting without its governor module. The team’s leader, 
    Dr. Mensah, asks Murderbot to help the crew determine why the creature did not appear 
    on their fauna report for the region. Murderbot appears without its armor, and its 
    human face and clothing shock the other team members, who have only seen it wearing 
    its opaque helmet and armor.</p>
