Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine. What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?

I went to yahoo on september 11, 2001 - that might seem morbid and maybe it is a little bit. I'm old enough to remember it and I remember thinking all the headlines must be fake. It looks very blocky and line heavy. It definitely does not have the streamed-lined look of most websites today!

Link to your screenshot using a relative URL. (Just like we've done in the last few weeks!)
