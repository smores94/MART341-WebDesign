    <p><h3>World's Best Lasagna</h3></p></body>
    <br>
    <br>       
    </p>I love this recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the 
    ingredient list to suit your needs. I like to double the spices, use oven-ready noodles,
    add red wine (merlot), and usually a bit of concentrated beef broth.
    If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, 
    these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:

<!--Possibly remove the below - seems annoying-->

    <ol>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>   
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles. I like the kind that cooks in the pan and with how saucy this is, they work great!</li>  
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li> 
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>  
      </ol>

<h2 style="color:red;">Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find step-by-step instructions in the recipe below:</h2>
<h1 style="color:red;">Directions</h1>
<h2 style="color:red;">Step 1</h2>
<br>
<p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color:red;">Step 2</h2>
<br>
<p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil (if using regular noodles - skip this step if using "Oven-ready"). Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons 
parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color:red;">Step 3</h2>
<br>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
<br>
<h2 style="color:red;">Step 4</h2>
<br>
<p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
    lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella 
    cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
    either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
    <br>
<h2 style="color:red;">Step 5</h2>
<br>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. 
Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23600/worlds-best-lasagna/">Having grown up in a family of excellent Italian cooks, I admit I am a "tough room" when it comes to Italian recipes. Despite that, this one is so good that I am sure my mother and grandmother are smiling down from heaven in approval! I saw this same recipe on another site and it only called for 1 teaspoon of salt, not 1 tablespoon. It came out perfect with the lower amount of salt. It also did not call for any salt in the ricotta. I have some recommendations, below: Cut down the water to 1/4 cup. It makes a slightly thicker sauce and I felt the lasagna holds up better that way (although this recipe is good even with more water). Use half parmesan and half romano cheese. It gives a slightly more robust flavor. Put a few tablespoons of the romano/parmesan cheese in with the ricotta mixture. Add a half teaspoon of grated nutmeg in with the ricotta mixture. Increase to one teaspoon of fennel seed. Use 23 ounces of ricotta instead of 16. Use bulk sausage meat if you can find it. Otherwise if you buy link sausage make sure to remove it from the casing and mix it with the ground beef. And finally (and this is very important), make the sauce the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. The sauce tastes better and better as it sits and develops more richness of body and flavor. Trust me, all of these changes will improve the recipe! Mangia!</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23600/worlds-best-lasagna/">Too much Tomato Paste for amount of liquid. Bring to a boil impossible without burning. Saved it by dumping a lot of red wine and some water in. Drank rest of red wine and felt better.</blockquote>
