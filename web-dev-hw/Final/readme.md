What is typography?
Typography is the design of the text on web pages. This includes the font pairings as well as stylized aspects such as letter design, kerning, and leading.

What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack? if your font won't function (or load up like mine) then there is an alternative available to make your website still function

What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
A system font refers to the fonts that are pre-installed on a user's computer or device, and can be used in any application on that system. Examples of system fonts include Arial, Times New Roman, and Helvetica.

A web font, on the other hand, is a font that is specifically designed to be used on websites. Web fonts are not pre-installed on the user's device, but are instead downloaded from a server when a website is loaded. This allows website designers to use a wider variety of fonts than are available as system fonts, and to ensure that their chosen font is displayed consistently across different devices and operating systems.

A web-safe font refers to a small set of fonts that are considered to be widely available on most operating systems and devices. These fonts include Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, and others. Web-safe fonts were commonly used in the early days of web design when support for custom fonts was limited, but they have since fallen out of favor due to the availability of web fonts and the ability to use custom fonts via CSS.
