How did your user testing sessions go? good, despite using senior citizens, I thought they gave
good feedback
<br>
What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
I changed font size, color, and then completely switched up one page and added another. I think it really helped it look better.
Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
I did a lot of revising of margins and padding. It neverending revising.
