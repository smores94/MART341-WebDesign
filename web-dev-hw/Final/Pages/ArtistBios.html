        <h2>Mark Maggiori</h2>
        <p>Mark Maggiori’s first views of America were framed within the front windshield
         of a car making its way from New York to San Francisco. That month-long trip, 
         filled with majestic views of the national parks and timeless glimpses of the 
         West, was made when Mark was only 15 years old and on vacation far from his 
         home in France, but its impact would ripple throughout his life and set into 
         motion his great fascination with the West.</p>

         <h2>Roseta Santiago</h2>
         <p>I was born and raised in the Washington DC area, the eldest among my 
         five siblings. My father was a chef on the aircraft carrier USS Missouri 
         and at the Blair House for Harry Truman while serving in the US Navy 
         for 35 years. He was born in the Philippine Islands to a Spanish father 
         and Filipino mother. My mother was born and raised in Pennsylvania. 
         Her parents were Irish, German and Polish, having fled from Europe because 
         of their ancestry. There is such mystery surrounding our heritage. This may 
         be a clue to my curiosity about subjects and the lineage of the objects I 
         paint. I am fascinated by mystery, illusion and the unknown. My determination 
         and drive came, no doubt, from my dad, who raised his large family based on a 
         third-grade education and hard work.</p>

         <h2>Brent Learned</h2>
         <p>The Oklahoma City painter, 51, has developed a colorful modus operandi
           that merges Native American themes with Pop art sensibilities. Considering 
           himself both an ambassador of his tribe and a diligent student of art history, 
           Learned's distinctive style has taken his work from the Smithsonian Institution 
           in Washington, D.C., to the official music video for the Redbone hit "Come and 
           Get Your Love" to the Oklahoma State Art Collection and beyond. </p>
        <p>“Brent creates art with the purpose of capturing the essence, accuracy and historic 
         authenticity of Oklahoma’s indigenous peoples. His work reflects an important nexus 
         of historic references and current influences in contemporary art," said Oklahoma 
         State Arts Council Executive Director Amber Sharples. "He contributes an important 
         voice to the Oklahoma State Art Collection, in conversation with other luminaries 
         such as T.C. Cannon and Allan Houser, who continue to influence artists both in and 
         beyond our state.”</p>

         <p>Colt Idol is a lifelong Montana resident, born and raised in Bigfork until 
          moving to Whitefish for his high school years. As he grew up, Idol spent most 
          of his time outdoors; whether it was hiking, fishing, or camping, he always 
          loved being in nature.</p>
         <p>Idol was a sport-focused student in high school, focusing primarily on basketball 
         and track and field. He was all-state three years in a row for basketball and track, 
         a state champion high jumper, and holds most records for basketball in Whitefish. 
         In 2009, Idol was committed to playing basketball for Montana State University in 
         Bozeman, but unfortunately tore his ACL. After numerous surgical procedures, Idol 
         made the decision to retire from his athletic career and focus his life on his art. 
         He spent his days at home painting with his father, Dick Idol, who is a well-known 
         painter, sculptor, and outdoorsman.</p>

         <h2>Todd Connor</h2>
         <p>Todd Connor a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, has lived and painted in Montana 
          for most of his professional career. His love of the outdoors grew from a 
          childhood spent camping, hunting and fishing. At the age of twelve he started 
          painting in pastels and oils. His subject matter ranged from landscapes to fish, 
          wildlife and western themes. </p>        

         <p>After high school, Todd took time off from painting and joined the Navy where 
         he served as a Navy SEAL in Coronado, California, and overseas. After the Navy 
         he traveled the country visiting historical sites and National Parks where his 
         love of history and the outdoors came together with his desire to pick up the 
         paint brush once again. </p>
          
         <p>Todd received a BFA in Illustration from the prestigious Art Center College 
         of Design in Pasadena, CA in 1997. After  graduation he worked as a colorboard 
         painter for Universal Studios Japan theme park project. In 1999,  Todd made 
         the move to Montana, painting full time, where he has met with much success. 
         A near sell out show in Bozeman in 2000 set his career in motion and he never 
         looked back.</p>

         <div class="text-box">
         <h2>Maura Allen</h2>
         <p>I studied Classical Studies (Latin) at Stanford and learned how literature, 
          politics, religion, science, sports and more interplay within a single culture. 
          I quickly realized the same holds true in the American West.</p>

         <p>The way story and cinema, song and symbol, landscape and legends combine and 
          contribute to our real and imagined view of the West is my focus. Native Americans,
           Lewis and Clark, Remington, Russell and dime store magazines were our first Western 
           storytellers and shaped our views. Song, photography and film soon added to the 
           mix — and mythology. Real issues — water, land and livestock, rodeo and ranching, 
           traditions, family and the environment — play out every day in America’s West. How 
           the real and imagined collide and coincide is the center of my work.</p> 
          
           <p>I start each piece on location, looking directly into the sun. Ranches, rodeos, and 
          vintage Main Street are my stage. With details obscured, I look for strong, iconic 
          silhouettes. In my studio, working on wood panel, glass and steel, I combine 
          “Old West” elements like vintage wall paper designs, typography and other symbols
           with those modern day Western moments resulting in a confluence of old and new, 
           historic and modern. To me, this is the West.</p>

        <img src="../Img/hagege1.jpg" alt="LOGAN MAXWELL HAGEGE"></a>
        <div class="text-box">
        <h2>Logan Maxwell Hagege</h2>
        <p>Logan Maxwell Hagege (b. 1980) is a Los Angeles based contemporary artist with 
          modern visions of the west. The paintings of Hagege exhibit all the hallmarks 
          of his classical art training from an academy in Southern California, a modern-day
           atelier, in which students refined their skills by drawing and painting live models 
           every day for years. </p>   

           <p>Yet, it is in the artist’s departures from strict realism where his work now draws
           its strength and where his vision is fed by a heady mix of nature and imagination. 
           A power born of observation, recollection and creative inspiration imbue Hagege 
           images of the American Southwest. He is arguably one of the most adept artistic 
           narrators telling and re-telling a modern story of a hauntingly beautiful desert land. </p>   
          
           <p> Hagege’s mature style, which he terms “stylized realism,” has made him a master of 
          geometric design where angles and edges are softened by the curve of billowing clouds. 
          His signature clouds often mimic the shapes of the blanketed figures in the foreground, 
          creating visual roadmaps for the viewers, further adding to the design, and narrative of 
          each composition. </p>

        <h2>Kyle Polzin</h2>
        <p>Born on January 16, 1974, Kyle Polzin grew up in South Texas, and began developing his 
          artistic skills at a young age under the guidance of his father. Brought up around horses
           and the Gulf coast, Kyle grew to appreciate the beauty and heritage of his Texas surroundings 
           which is reflected in his art. He worked closely with his grandfathers who were both skilled
            carpenters, and through their teachings, learned the value of craftsmanship and the reward 
            of creating with your hands.</p>

         <p>In 1992 Kyle began his formal training in fine art at Victoria College with emphasis in 
          oil painting. During this time, he participated in instructional sessions under Dalhart Windberg, 
          whose work has influenced him since boyhood. After college Kyle worked as a graphic artist 
          and web designer while painting in his free time. As his popularity and success as a painter 
          grew, he switched to painting full time in 2000.</p>

        <h2>Brett Allen Johnson</h2>
        <p>Watching the land change ever so subtly out the window of the family car, that was the 
          part that fascinated a young Brett Allen Johnson as he and his siblings would make the trip 
          from northern Utah to Arizona. They would pass through places named Nephi, Hatch, Mt. Carmel, 
          Kanab, Page, Wupatki, Vermilion Cliffs and Bitter Springs, each one as odd and wonderful as 
          the one before it. The snow-capped peaks would shift to shallow grass-lined valleys with pinon 
          and juniper, and then to pine forests and desert moonscapes with vast fields of rock and sand 
          bleached white like bone.</p>

        <p>Their destination was Sedona, where Johnson’s grandparents had a home amid the pristine desertscapes 
        of Northern Arizona. His grandmother was a watercolor artist who would frequently paint the 
        Southwest, so the Arizona trips would include adventures outdoors and the exploration of her 
        studio and art supplies. The young artist didn’t know it at the time, but these trips would be 
        milestones in his career.</p>

        <div class="text-box">
        <h2>Dick Idol</h2>
        <p>First a little history… In his younger days, Dick Idol grew up in the rural countryside of 
          North Carolina where he spent most of his time in the woods and playing sports. As an athlete, 
          he played football and baseball on a full-ride scholarship to North Carolina State University, 
          resulting in offers to play in the NFL. However, his passion was always the outdoors. After 
          college, Dick moved to Alaska where he owned and operated one of the top taxidermy businesses, 
          which eventually evolved to include guiding, outfitting and booking hunts for big game clients 
          around the world. In the 1970’s Dick began to focus on his special interest, whitetail deer. 
          Over the next three decades, he amassed the greatest whitetail antler collection in the world, 
          which included the famous Hole-In-the-Horn buck and many state records. That collection now 
          resides in the Bass-Pro Museum in Springfield, MO.</p>
          
          <p>In the 1980’s, he co-founded North American Whitetail magazine and launched a show circuit 
          displaying his Whitetail collection, which often included Dick as an expert seminar speaker, 
          also helping to launch numerous Whitetail shows in several states, including the Dixie Deer 
          Classic in Raleigh, NC. With all his exposure from writing books and articles, his show 
          circuits and speaking, instructional videos, television shows, product endorsements, operation 
          of Whitetail hunts and many other Whitetail activities, he soon became the most widely 
          recognized personality in the world of the Whitetail.</p>

        <div class="text-box">
        <h2>Whitney Gardner</h2>
        <p>Whitney Gardner is an oil painter born and based in Southern California. With a focus 
          in painting landscapes about the Southwest, she seeks to expand the barriers of western 
          art to the deserts of the far west in which she calls home. Residing in the Mojave desert
           for over decade, a fascination with the rugged scenery has led her into an artful study
            of this region. From plein air to studio rendered compositions, her paintings are an ode
             to the remarkable facets of the desert.</p>

        <p>Whitney attained a BFA at California College of the Arts in 2010. Her work has been 
         published in the nationally circulated magazines such as, Western Art Collector and Southwest Art.
          In 2019 her painting, Ocotillo Sky, received the Best of Show award at the Joshua Tree National 
          Park Art Exposition and in September 2022 her painting, Stone Wash, received the Best Painting 
          award at Slopoke Western Art Show. In May 2021 she had her first ever sell-out show with Western 
          Gallery. </p>

         <div class="text-box">
         <h2>Nikita Coulombe</h2>
         <p>My journey as an artist began early in life. I was born in Winnipeg, Canada, 
          in 1986 and as a child spent many hours during the long winters being creative 
          any way that I could. Knitting, sewing, crayons, you name it. This passion continued 
          to evolve and I later went on to study painting formally at the University of 
          Colorado along with psychology. </p>
                                   
        <p>Initially, psychology was my path. For several years, I worked closely with 
          social psychologist and past APA President, Dr. Philip Zimbardo, supporting the 
          early development of the Heroic Imagination Project and co-writing a book called 
          Man Interrupted, which was published in over a dozen countries. I later helped 
          launch the documentary film, The Red Pill, directed by Cassie Jaye, and provided 
          research assistance for Dr. Warren Farrell's book, The Boy Crisis, co-authored 
          with Dr. John Gray. </p>  
          
        <p>In 2019, I felt compelled to focus on painting. The underlying themes of my 
          paintings revolve around nature, the human experience, and the balance of our 
          inner and outer worlds. Currently, I am based in Dallas, Texas, and am working 
          on diverse series simultaneously, including wildlife, abstract, and conceptual 
          paintings.</p>

          <h2>Jeremy Lipking</h2>
          <p>In a remarkably short period of time, Jeremy Lipking has emerged as one of the 
            country's premier realist artists. His talent, which rivals that of the late 
            nineteenth century painterly realists such as John Singer Sargent, Joaquin Sorolla
             and Anders Zorn, is outstanding for a painter of any age. Like these great 
             painters of the past, Lipking is a virtuoso artist. His canvases convey the magical 
             aura of convincing imagery emerging out of a field of paint.</p>

               Her parents were Irish, German and Polish, having fled from Europe because

               <h2>Maura Allen</h2>
               <p>I studied Classical Studies (Latin) at Stanford and learned how literature, 
                politics, religion, science, sports and more interplay within a single culture. 
                I quickly realized the same holds true in the American West.</p>

               <p>The way story and cinema, song and symbol, landscape and legends combine and 
                contribute to our real and imagined view of the West is my focus. Native Americans,
                 Lewis and Clark, Remington, Russell and dime store magazines were our first Western 
                 storytellers and shaped our views. Song, photography and film soon added to the 
                 mix — and mythology. Real issues — water, land and livestock, rodeo and ranching, 
                 traditions, family and the environment — play out every day in America’s West. How 
                 the real and imagined collide and coincide is the center of my work.</p> 
                
                 <p>I start each piece on location, looking directly into the sun. Ranches, rodeos, and 
                vintage Main Street are my stage. With details obscured, I look for strong, iconic 
                silhouettes. In my studio, working on wood panel, glass and steel, I combine 
                “Old West” elements like vintage wall paper designs, typography and other symbols
                 with those modern day Western moments resulting in a confluence of old and new, 
                 historic and modern. To me, this is the West.</p>

              <p>Logan Maxwell Hagege (b. 1980) is a Los Angeles based contemporary artist with 
                modern visions of the west. The paintings of Hagege exhibit all the hallmarks 
                of his classical art training from an academy in Southern California, a modern-day
                 atelier, in which students refined their skills by drawing and painting live models 
                 every day for years. </p>   

                 <p>Yet, it is in the artist’s departures from strict realism where his work now draws
                 its strength and where his vision is fed by a heady mix of nature and imagination. 
                 A power born of observation, recollection and creative inspiration imbue Hagege 
                 images of the American Southwest. He is arguably one of the most adept artistic 
                 narrators telling and re-telling a modern story of a hauntingly beautiful desert land. </p>   
                
                 <p> Hagege’s mature style, which he terms “stylized realism,” has made him a master of 
                geometric design where angles and edges are softened by the curve of billowing clouds. 
                His signature clouds often mimic the shapes of the blanketed figures in the foreground, 
                creating visual roadmaps for the viewers, further adding to the design, and narrative of 
                each composition. </p>

                the one before it. The snow-capped peaks would shift to shallow grass-lined valleys with pinon 
                and juniper, and then to pine forests and desert moonscapes with vast fields of rock and sand 
                bleached white like bone.</p>

              <p>Their destination was Sedona, where Johnson’s grandparents had a home amid the pristine desertscapes 
              of Northern Arizona. His grandmother was a watercolor artist who would frequently paint the 
              Southwest, so the Arizona trips would include adventures outdoors and the exploration of her 
              studio and art supplies. The young artist didn’t know it at the time, but these trips would be 
              milestones in his career.</p>

                around the world. In the 1970’s Dick began to focus on his special interest, whitetail deer. 
                Over the next three decades, he amassed the greatest whitetail antler collection in the world, 
                which included the famous Hole-In-the-Horn buck and many state records. That collection now

                also helping to launch numerous Whitetail shows in several states, including the Dixie Deer 
                Classic in Raleigh, NC. With all his exposure from writing books and articles, his show 
                circuits and speaking, instructional videos, television shows, product endorsements, operation 
                of Whitetail hunts and many other Whitetail activities, he soon became the most widely

                in 1986 and as a child spent many hours during the long winters being creative 
                any way that I could. Knitting, sewing, crayons, you name it. This passion continued 
                to evolve and I later went on to study painting formally at the University of 
                Colorado along with psychology. </p>
                                         
              <p>Initially, psychology was my path. For several years, I worked closely with 
                social psychologist and past APA President, Dr. Philip Zimbardo, supporting the 
                early development of the Heroic Imagination Project and co-writing a book called 
                Man Interrupted, which was published in over a dozen countries. I later helped 
                launch the documentary film, The Red Pill, directed by Cassie Jaye, and provided 
                research assistance for Dr. Warren Farrell's book, The Boy Crisis, co-authored 
                with Dr. John Gray. </p>  
                
              <p>In 2019, I felt compelled to focus on painting. The underlying themes of my 
                paintings revolve around nature, the human experience, and the balance of our 
                inner and outer worlds. Currently, I am based in Dallas, Texas, and am working 
                on diverse series simultaneously, including wildlife, abstract, and conceptual 
                paintings.</p>

                <h2>Jeremy Lipking</h2>
                <p>In a remarkably short period of time, Jeremy Lipking has emerged as one of the 
                  country's premier realist artists. His talent, which rivals that of the late 
                  nineteenth century painterly realists such as John Singer Sargent, Joaquin Sorolla
                   and Anders Zorn, is outstanding for a painter of any age. Like these great 
                   painters of the past, Lipking is a virtuoso artist. His canvases convey the magical 
                   aura of convincing imagery emerging out of a field of paint.</p>
