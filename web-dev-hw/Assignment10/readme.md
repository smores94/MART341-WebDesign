Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

The Universal selector (*) matches any element in an HTML document. The Element selector (tagname) matches all occurrences of a specific HTML tag in a document. The Class selector (.classname) matches all elements with a specific class attribute, while the ID selector (#idname) matches a single element with a specific ID attribute.

When styling content, choosing a selector type depends on the desired specificity of the CSS rule. The Universal selector has the lowest specificity and should be used sparingly as it may lead to unintended consequences. The Element selector has a slightly higher specificity and is useful for styling all occurrences of a particular tag in a document. The Class selector has a higher specificity than the Element selector and is useful for targeting specific groups of elements with a shared class attribute. The ID selector has the highest specificity and should be used when targeting a specific element with a unique ID attribute.

Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?
I used adobe color and one of the paintings I chose for my site - I liked the combos of dark and light in the painting itself and I thought it looked pretty

Optional: discuss any challenges you faced this week, and how you overcame them.
I don't think I have overcame them - I tried implementing part of my style sheet about 400x and I'm still not sure what I've done wrong - I stuck the whole code in plnkr and it still "looks" right, but I can't
figure out why some of the headings won't work.
