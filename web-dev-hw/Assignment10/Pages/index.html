<h3>Oregon Trail</h3>
<p>The Oregon Trail is graced with “purple mountain majesty” and a red-tinged, blazing sunset in this quintessentially Romantic Landscape of the West. Artist Albert Bierstadt idealized the West by dramatizing its wide-open spaces, rocky ridges, and lush greenery with his adroit use of Luminism.

The technique combined depth, detail, and darkness to reflect not only the vastness of nature, but humanity’s place within it. The painting beckons us in to the tale of the determined spirit that this fifty-wagon party of emigrants depended upon for their journey of over 2,000 miles.
              
Bierstadt’s painted emigrants in The Oregon Trail were a group of Germans the artist happened upon during his expedition through the Rocky Mountain pass. This chance meeting affected Bierstadt immensely since his own family had emigrated from Germany when he was only a toddler. By immortalizing them in his sweeping panorama of the West, the artist gives us a point of reference that he himself could identify with.
              
This artist was part of the Hudson River School, a mid-nineteenth century group of Romantic Landscape painters, so named for the area in which the movement began. To create this highly theatrical style, Bierstadt often used inexact topography—while altering details and depth—to invoke the vastness of the wilds one could only find in the West.
              
Bierstadt’s oversized canvases were richly lavished with such breathtaking views—magnificent panoramas—that those who had seen these paintings were compelled to travel the West by train to witness it for themselves. However, it is rumored that when they finally reached the real West, the travelers were disappointed by the comparatively dull view.
              
This romantic idealization of the West is considered to be a response to the growing industrialization of America. The longing for the natural, unconfined beauty and boundless wonder of the pristine frontier was an inspiration that many of the Hudson River School could not ignore.</p>

<h3>A Storm in the Rocky Mountains</h3>
<p>Albert Bierstadt was a skilled showman. Here, he reorganized Rocky Mountain landmarks, exaggerated their scale, and introduced dramatic weather to thrill audiences at a moment when the North American continent was under rapid development. Bierstadt’s display for profit of theatrically lit large canvases like this one was a forerunner of today’s movies.

In 1863 Bierstadt made on-site studies for the work, which he completed in his New York studio. The painting had a personal significance, for “Mt. Rosalie” (now Mount Evans) was named by the artist in honor of his traveling companion’s wife, Rosalie Osborne Ludlow, whom Bierstadt would marry in 1866 following her divorce.</p>

<h3>Last of the Buffalo</h3>
<p>The Last of the Buffalo is Albert Bierstadt's final, great, western painting. Measuring six by ten feet, it mirrors in size his first massive oil, Lake Lucerne (1858), also in the National Gallery of Art collection. The ambitious landscape combines a variety of elements he had sketched during multiple western excursions. Because of its composite nature, the view incorporates many topographical features representative of the Great Plains: the dead and injured buffalo in the foreground occupy a dry, golden meadow; their counterparts cross a wide river in the middle ground; and others graze as far as the eye can see as the landscape turns to prairies, hills, mesas, and snowcapped peaks. Likewise, the fertile landscape nurtures a profusion of plains wildlife, including elk, coyote, antelopepronghorn, fox, rabbits, and even a prairie dog at lower left.

Many of these animals turn to look at the focal group of a man on horseback locked in combat with a charging buffalo. In contrast with his careful record of flora and fauna, the artist's rendering of this confrontation and its backdrop of seemingly limitless herds is a romantic invention rather than an accurate depiction of life on the frontier. By the time Bierstadt painted this canvas, the buffalo was on the verge of extinction. The animals had been reduced in population to only about 1,000 from 30 million at the beginning of the century. Scattering buffalo skulls and other bones around the deadly battle, Bierstadt created what one scholar described as "a masterfully conceived fiction that addressed contemporary issues" one that references, even laments, the destruction wrought by encroaching settlement. However, at about this time, efforts to preserve the buffalo began to garner support. In 1886, when Smithsonian Institution taxidermist William T. Hornaday traveled west, he was so distraught by the decimation of the buffalo that he became a preservationist. He returned to Washington with specimens for the Smithsonian and also with live buffalo for the National Zoo, which he helped establish in 1889 one year after Bierstadt completed this painting.</p>

<h3>Scenery in the Grand Tetons</h3>
<p>What's in a name? In this case, it's all in the name - Scenery in the Grand Tetons. Perhaps the oddest thing to report about this painting is that is almost certainly not a real "place." There's no record of Bierstadt traveling to theTetons. In 1881, years after he completed this painting, he traveled toYellowstone National Park, which is very near the Tetons. One can hope he glimpsed the Tetons from afar, but he certainly was not there to paint the scene. Although probably not the Tetons, it is very similar to some of his workin the California high country. Scenery in the Grand Tetons is most likely a conjectural scene from his extensive travels in the Sierra. Unlike many artists, Bierstadt was very successful in his lifetime and knew how to sell his art...and a title that captured the imagination about the wonders found in the West was a great sales pitch.

Bierstadt arrived out west partly at the largess of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1863, and promptlymet a future railroad president in Frederick Billings. Billings was already a successful land attorney in San Francisco, having practiced law there since the early days of the gold rush with his firm Halleck, Peachy, and Billings, and later filled several roles including president with the Northern PacificRailway Company. The Northern Pacific completed its transcontinental connectionin 1883 and both Frederick and Julia Billings were there to strike the ceremonial last spike. The Northern Pacific would make accessible like never before areas like the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Park.  </div>

<h3>Buffalo Trail: The Impending Storm, 1869</h3>
<p>By 1869, when he created this idyllic view, Albert Bierstadt had made two extensive trips to the American West. He based this lush scene of buffalo peacefully making their way across a river or creek against a roiling sky on views he had sketched during one or both of those expeditions. In a letter he wrote on September 3, 1859 during his excursion with the survey team of US Army Colonel Frederick W. Lander, the artist describes one such scene. He recorded his awe at encountering the majestic buffalo in a passage that could easily describe Buffalo Trail: Impending Storm:

We find here plenty of buffalo. One morning we saw a noble looking animal crossing the river near us, and I alighted from my ambulance and took a position behind a bluff, in order to give him a reception. As he came splashing through the water, I felt half inclined to lay down my rifle and take up my sketchbook, but I was so wrapped in admiration and study I could do neither for a few moments.
              
Bierstadt's meticulous attention to detail and texture, as well as his tightly brushed technique—results of his early training in Düsseldorf, Germany—characterize this bucolic, romantic scene. </div>
