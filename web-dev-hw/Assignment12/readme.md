What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
Padding, margin, and borders are all CSS properties used for styling and layout purposes.

Padding is the space between an element's content and its border. It is used to create space inside an element and can be applied to all four sides of the element or individually.

Margin is the space between an element's border and the neighboring elements. It is used to create space between elements and can be applied to all four sides of the element or individually. 

Borders are the lines that surround an element's content and padding. They are used to visually separate one element from another and can be customized in terms of style, color, and thickness using the border property. Borders can also be applied individually to each side of the element.

Optional: how did this week's assignment go? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
It went ok. I would have liked to work on the drop down more, I ended up deleting some of the parts I was working on so I could get it turned in.
