Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

Web browsers function by sending requests to web servers for web resources; such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which are then displayed to the user. The browser also uses various technologies, such as JavaScript and HTML5, to provide dynamic content and interactivity on web pages. The browser's rendering engine displays the content and applies styling information, such as the layout and color, to the page. The browser also manages the browser history, caches frequently-accessed and resourcesd.
