In your README.md file, please describe the difference between semantic and structural markup.

Semantics explains the purpose of an element - semantic itself means related to language which helps explain why it is used to describe the "purpose" that the semantic markup is making - not visual
 
Structural markup explains the purpose of an elememt in relation to other elements
