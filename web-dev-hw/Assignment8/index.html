<strong><h2 style="color:red;">Dogs in History</h2></strong>

<br>     
<p>The relationship between people and dogs dates back thousands of years, 
with evidence of domesticated dogs dating as far back as 15,000 years ago. 
It is believed that dogs were initially domesticated from wolves by early 
human societies who discovered their usefulness in hunting, herding, and 
guarding. Over time, dogs became more than just working animals and began 
to play a more significant role in human society as beloved companions.</p>
<br>
<p>Throughout history, dogs have been highly valued by various cultures 
around the world. In ancient Egypt, for example, dogs were revered and 
often depicted in art and mythology. They were believed to be guardians 
of the afterlife and were often buried alongside their owners. In ancient
Greece, dogs were used for hunting, guarding, and even as symbols of 
loyalty and fidelity. The philosopher Aristotle even wrote about the unique 
bond between humans and dogs.</p>
<br>         
<p>During the Middle Ages, dogs continued to play important roles in society. 
They were used for hunting, herding, and as watchdogs, and were often 
kept by royalty and wealthy landowners as status symbols. In the Renaissance 
era, dogs became popular subjects in art and literature, with famous 
artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Durer featuring dogs in their works.</p>
<br>          
<p>In more recent times, dogs have continued to be valued for their companionship 
and loyalty. During World War I and II, dogs were used as messengers, scouts, 
and even as bomb-sniffing dogs. Today, dogs are often trained as service 
animals to assist people with disabilities, and are also used in law enforcement 
and search and rescue operations.</p>
<br>
Despite their long history of coexisting with humans, dogs have not always been 
treated with kindness and respect. In some cultures, dogs have been considered 
unclean or even dangerous, leading to their mistreatment and abuse. However, 
as our understanding of the unique bond between humans and dogs has grown, more 
and more people are recognizing the importance of treating dogs with love and care, 
and providing them with the same level of compassion and respect that they offer to us.

      <p>The Maltese breed is not known for having a specific ranking system of top dogs. 
        However, when it comes to qualities such as temperament, health, and appearance, 
        there are some general characteristics that reputable breeders and organizations 
        look for in a high-quality Maltese:</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Health: A healthy Maltese dog should have a shiny coat, bright eyes, and healthy skin. It's important to look for a breeder who performs health testing on their breeding dogs to minimize the risk of genetic health issues.</li>
              <li>Temperament: A well-bred Maltese should be affectionate, friendly, and outgoing. They should also be trainable and eager to please their owners.</li>
              <li>Size: The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard for Maltese dogs specifies that they should be between 4 and 7 pounds in weight and 8 to 10 inches in height at the shoulder.</li>
              <li>Coat: A high-quality Maltese should have a long, silky coat that is white in color. The coat should be free from tangles and matting, and should be groomed regularly to keep it looking its best.</li> 
              <li>Conformation: Maltese dogs should have a square, compact body with a level topline and well-arched neck. Their head should be round and their eyes should be large and dark. The ears should be set high and carried erect, and the tail should be carried over the back.
            </ol>
<p>Ultimately, the most important thing when choosing a Maltese dog is to find a reputable 
breeder who cares about the health and well-being of their dogs, and who can provide you with 
a puppy that meets these general standards of quality.</p>
