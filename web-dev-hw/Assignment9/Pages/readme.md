Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
<br>
I had a lot of difficulty, for some reason, with relative paths. Had to use full paths to make it function. Not sure if this is because 1/2 way through I decided to rearrange my file structure. Didn't realize how much of java I had forgot. Going to havev to do a refresher on that.
<br>
After we come back from spring break we will start to dive into CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
<br>
I think I'm making things harder for myself, so I'm hoping I can get css going better (for myself)
